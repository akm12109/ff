# Working
Hey guys let's start some phishing and catch some I'd and password.

With this tool anyone can easily hack someone Free Fire id and password.

This tools in First step uses PHP to upload all the files on localhost and

in Second step it uses Ngrok to create a cloud server and upload all the localhost files on that cloud server.

and in Last but not least it uses some URL shortener websites to shorten the URL, so no one can suspect that it is a fake link.
